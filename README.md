# Company Employee Tracker

This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming in JavaScript using ES6 `class` syntax, including inheritance and method overriding. It features an `Employee` class and a `Manager` subclass, both with a `describe()` method. A `Company` class manages an array of employees and provides methods to add and list them. To run the project, open `index.html` in your browser and view the output in the developer console. All code follows ES6 standards and avoids the use of `prototype`.
